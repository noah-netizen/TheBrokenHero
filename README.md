# TheBrokenHero

I hope you enjoy this little preview! I wanted to trying using JavaScript to make a game, so I found a great tutorial from Mr. Erdreich on youtube I used as a framework since I'd never used P5.js before. I obviosuly wanted to spice it up a bit, and I've been really intrigued with AI lately. I was fortunate enough to be able to get github copilot to try out which helped a ton and make it pretty fun to use (BTW, most of the comments actually came from copilot. It weas great for explaining texts of code that I was having a hard time understanding). I also used ChatGPT, which game me some really funny quirks in my game that I wanted to keep. AI helped make my game work, but it did some funny things along the way.

I will be using this as a template for my final project, and I will work to add some new levels and details to the game!
